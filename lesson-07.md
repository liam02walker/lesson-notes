**Control Flow**
- This is how the script is read, usually top to bottom line by line

**Functions**
- Functions in JavaScript are as follows: function FUNCTION_NAME(PARAMETRE) {CODE INSIDE THESE}
- The function then won't be ran until the name of it is used somewhere in the code
- A function can be called upon at any point of a script and the function doesn't need to be in the same script

**Operators**
- Operators are mathmatical symbols, +, -, * and /

**Comparators**
- Is == which says is it equal to instead of setting
- != means not equal to
- >, <, <=, >= etc etc these are also comparators
- === Means strictly equal to, you can not change it always equals x
- !== Strictly not equal to

**Comparisons**
- This is when you compare 2 different values

**Expression**
- This is a code that is evaluated and resolves to a value

**Conditions**
- These are conditions that have to be met for the if statement to run

**Parameters**
- This is inside of the brackets of a function ready to be set
- Seperate each parameter with a ,

**Arguments**
- This is when you define the parameter after the function
