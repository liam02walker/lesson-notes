# Lesson #7

**Control Flow**
- This is how the script is read, usually top to bottom line by line

**Functions**
- Functions in JavaScript are as follows: function FUNCTION_NAME(PARAMETRE) {CODE INSIDE THESE}
- The function then won't be ran until the name of it is used somewhere in the code
- A function can be called upon at any point of a script and the function doesn't need to be in the same script
