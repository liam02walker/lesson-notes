# Lesson #2

**Terminal**
-You can do a whole bunch of different codes inside of the terminal which includes, but not limited:
1. Create/Change a directory (mkdir FILE_NAME)
2. Create/Change a file (touch FILE_NAME)
3. Open VC Code (code .)

**VS Code**
-VS Code is useful as it can auto complete sections and tell you what part of your code is incorrect if at all
-VS Code can also colour coordinate your code so you know what parts are which such as, functions, <header> etc
