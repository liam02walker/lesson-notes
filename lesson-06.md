- Runtime Object Construction
- Variable Parameter Lists
- Function Variables
- Dynamic Script Creation
- Object Introspection

*JavaScript is very different to Java language!*

**Variables**
- *NEVER use var to define a variable!*
- You can declare a variable in 4 ways, var, let, const
- You can provide a value to a variable which can be: number, boolean or string
- You name your variable at the start example: let NAME_VARIABLE = BOOLEAN
