# Lesson #8

**Loops**
- There are 2 loops, for loops and while loops

**Initialize**
- Setting an initial value to a variable that is right of the operator "="

**Declaration**
- Declares the creation of the variable

**Increment**
- ++ means add 1 to something

**Decrement**
- -- Means take 1 away from something

**Iteration**
- This is the repetition of a process in order to generate a sequence of outcomes
- Each repetition is one iteration, the outcome of each iteration is the start of the next one, 6+1 = 7, now the next iteration will start with 7

**For Loop**
- for (set initial value; a condition it needs to meet; update the value after each variable) {CODE IN HERE}

**While Loop**
-
