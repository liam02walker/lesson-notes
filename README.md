## Growth Mindset
**Growth mindset** is having a mindset that is willing to learn and able to progress through failures and success.
It is being able to learn form past _mistakes_ and carrying on instead of giving up after a setback.
You also need to see other's success as something that you can also do instead of seeing it as a threat.

### Reminders:
- Always learn from past mistakes
- Ask for help if I end up stuck at some point
- Be willing to acquire new skills and develop them

### Applying Reminders
1. Understand what mistake was made and find a solution
2. If stuck for 15 minutes then ask for help
3. Listen to lessons and apply the knowledge learnt
